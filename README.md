ElixirSublime
==========================

Ensure Elixir is on Sublime's PATH by settings.

```json
{
	"env": {
		"PATH": "path to elixir bins"
	}
}
```

If you want linting support then install `SublimeLinter3`.

The plugin currently does not understand aliases so autocompletion with them does not work.
