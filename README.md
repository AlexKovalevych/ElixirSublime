ElixirSublime
==========================

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishnevskiy/ElixirSublime/master/ext/example.png)

README coming...

Ensure Elixir is on Sublime's PATH by settings.

```json
{
	"env": {
		"PATH": "path to elixir bins"
	}
}
```

Shift click on a module or function to go to definition.

If you want linting support then install `SublimeLinter3`.

The plugin currently does not understand aliases so autocompletion with them does not work.
